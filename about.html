    <p class="paragraph">I am a second year at Georgia Tech studying Computational Media, an interdisplinary program that combines computer science and interaction design.
        Through my time at Georgia Tech, I have learned how technology is able to affect the human condition. I have gained technical expertise from my computer science classes as well as creative skills from my design classes. 
        My courses such as Object-Oriented Programming, Object and Design and, Visual Design have adqueately prepared me for a career in technology.
        My passion for design lies where product design meets digital well-being. As a designer and front-end developer my goal is to create meaningful experiences that enhance peoples lives.

    <h1>why design?</h1>
    <p>my love for creating began in second grade when my childhood friend and i ran over to each other’s houses to make what we called “secret inventions”--rummaging through our garbage and recycling bins, we made contraptions out of scraps to fix everyday problems around our homes.

        ikea was my version of disneyland. with a mouthwatering $1.00 soft serve in hand, i wandered around the never-ending aisles of furniture, storage cabinets, and containers. laying down on the bean bags, i would stare at the hanging lights in awe of how everything was so simple yet ingenious. though i didn’t know it at the time, looking back this was the root of my love for product design. and...i guess the rest is history (or a story i’d love to share with you!)</p>
